# go-html-to-markdown

This is a little pandoc knock off go program that renders markdown files into html, including templating.
I created this thing just for rendering my homepage html files, and not to make some high quality software.
So it is what it is, not more and not less.

Its should be somewhat intuitive to understand how its works when you look at the config, templates and the example markdown.
Or at leased that what i am telling myself to not write documentation.

```bash
# build
./build.sh

# render
./render.sh
```
